	This is a postfix(Reverse polish) polynomial calculator.  Its purpose is to add, subtract, muliply and
	divide polynomials.  It works in both postfix and infix notation.  For postfix, simply put spaces between
	the terms, while for infix, put no spaces in.  It will simplify the polynomial after the evaluation and 
	give an answer.  The calculator keeps getting input until q is inputed, which ends the program.  Carots 
	are used to show exponents, and x's are variables.
